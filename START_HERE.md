## 📦 About node_modules & dist (NOT Pushed to GitHub)

**THIS IS CORRECT! ✅**

Your `.gitignore` file correctly prevents these from being pushed:
- `node_modules/` - 150MB+ of dependencies (unnecessary in git)
- `dist/` - Build output (regenerated each time)

**What IS pushed to GitHub:**
- Source code (`src/` folder)
- Public assets (`public/services.json`)
- Configuration files
- Documentation

**GitHub Pages serves from `gh-pages` branch:**
- This branch contains only the built files
- Created automatically by `npm run deploy`
- You don't need to manually manage this branch

---

## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT

### Step 1: Verify Setup (Optional but Recommended)

Open PowerShell in `D:\project` and run:
```powershell
.\check-setup.bat
```

This checks if everything is configured correctly.

---

### Step 2: Deploy Your Fixed Project

**Option A: Use Deploy Script (EASIEST)**

```powershell
.\deploy-fix.bat
```

This will:
1. Build your project
2. Commit changes
3. Push to GitHub
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Option B: Manual Deployment**

```powershell
# Build
npm run build

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Services path for GitHub Pages"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

---

### Step 3: Wait & Verify

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update
2. **Visit:** https://munsifkhanafg.github.io/service-booking-app/
3. **Verify:**
   - You should see 30 services
   - Search should work
   - Filters should work
   - Everything should work perfectly

3. **Try incognito mode** - To bypass cache
4. **Check Console** - F12 → Console tab for errors

### Build fails?

```powershell
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

### Deploy fails?

```powershell
# Install gh-pages
npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# Try again
npm run deploy

# Check remote
git remote -v
